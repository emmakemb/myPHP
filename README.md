# myPHP
API Google
Register allows us to register in our Database. it will therefore manage all the Errors linked to this circumstance.

Config allows a connection with our database (here we use the PhpmyAdmin (intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web) in the Wampsever). And also to create a repository in which the user data will be saved but this can be done manually in the DB.

Reset: not too important for our Project but allows to update Password on the Database and destroy the old session.

Welcome if the registration or login was successful, then we are directly directed to welcomme. welcome displays our chosen google API elements. And create Grids to be able to separate them and resize them.

index is used to style Welcome

index2 is used to style register and login.

login allows you to identify yourself in the database if the user already exists there and is also used to manage errors related to this.

Basically our Project aims to redirect us to a Google API that gives current Bitcoin Infos. But to access it, you will have to sign in into our Database if you are already registered or register first if this is not the case. Once all these conditions have been met, you can therefore have access to our informations.
  
  Wampsever (formerly WAMP5) is a WAMP type web development platform, allowing to operate locally (without having to connect to an external server)
